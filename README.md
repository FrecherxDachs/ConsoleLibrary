ConsoleLibrary
==============

This library provides a small set of functionality, to develop little programs for console environments
These programs should normally run on both, UNIX und Windows operating systems.

- This library will use nCurses, to run under Unix-based systems
- This library will use WinAPI, to run under Windows-Based systems

This library can only support functiony which are supported by these two underlaying libraries.
So it is a reduced set of features, to create simple console applications on multiple systems easily.
